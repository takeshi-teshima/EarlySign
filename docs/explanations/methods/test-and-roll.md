### Test and Roll Strategy
**Achieve the fastest tests and the safest rollouts in a single workflow.**

This is a highly practical deployment strategy used by many web services. It consists of first running an A/B test on a small subset of users (the **Test** phase), and then progressively deploying the winning variant to all users (the **Roll** phase).

* **EarlySign's Role:**
    * **Accelerating the Test Phase:** By using EarlySign's core sequential methods (like E-values or SPRT), you can determine a statistically reliable winner much faster and with a fraction of the traffic (e.g., 5%).
    * **Monitoring the Roll Phase:** The rollout itself carries risk. EarlySign continuously monitors key business and system metrics at each stage of the rollout (e.g., 10% → 50% → 100%). It ensures the winning variant doesn't cause unexpected negative impacts not seen in the test (e.g., high server load, poor experience for a specific user segment), guaranteeing a safe deployment.
