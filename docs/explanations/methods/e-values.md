### Anytime-Valid Inference with E-values
**Look anytime, as many times as you want. A cutting-edge approach for real-time monitoring.**

An E-value (Evidence-value) is a new metric representing the strength of evidence. The key feature of this approach is that there is **no need to pre-specify analysis times**. You can update the results as each new data point arrives and stop the test whenever you choose, all while maintaining statistical validity.

* **Use Cases:**
    * Real-time A/B testing for high-traffic services.
    * Continuous monitoring scenarios like fraud detection or system anomaly detection.
    * Ad-hoc analysis requests, such as "I need the results by the next meeting."
* **Key Features:**
    * **Anytime-valid p-values:** Calculates p-values that can be correctly interpreted at any time.
    * **Streaming Data Compatibility:** Integrates new data as it arrives to update the E-value.
