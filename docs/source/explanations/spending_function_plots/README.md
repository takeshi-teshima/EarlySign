# Spending function plots

This folder contains plotting utilities and sample plots used to compare different alpha-spending families. The plot script is in the repository root `docs/explanations/spending_function_plots/plot_spending_functions.py` â€” to include its output in the docs, consider running the script and embedding the generated images (or convert the script into a short markdown explanation).
